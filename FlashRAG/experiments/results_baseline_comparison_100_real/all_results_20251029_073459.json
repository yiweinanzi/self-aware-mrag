Of the many different Psittacidae (true parrots) genera, six are classified as macaws: \"\"Ara\"\", \"\"Anodorhynchus\"\", \"\"Cyanopsitta\"\", \"\"Primolius\"\", \"\"Orthopsittaca\"\", and \"\"Diopsittaca\"\". Previously, the members of the genus \"\"Primolius\"\" were placed in \"\"Propyrrhura\"\", but the former is correct in accordance with ICZN rules. Macaws are native to Central America and North America (only Mexico), South America, and formerly the Caribbean. Most species are associated with forests, especially rainforests, but others prefer woodland or savannah-like habitats. Proportionately larger beaks, long tails, and relatively bare, light-coloured, medial (facial patch) areas distinguish macaws from other parrots.\"",

The smaller engines were commonly air-cooled and located at the rear of the vehicle; compression ratios were relatively low.

Examples include ripening by exposure to light for several days and wrapping the fruit in paper (probably because this increases the ethylene concentration of the surrounding air). Ethylene ripening can be increased in reliability and evenness, and the process can be greatly accelerated by adding ethylene gas to the atmosphere in which the fruit is stored. For domestic purposes, the most convenient and effective process is to store the ripening persimmons in a clean, dry container together with other varieties of fruit that give off particularly large quantities of ethylene while they are ripening; apples and related fruits\"",

The McIntosh is most commonly cultivated in Canada, the United States, and eastern Europe. The parentage of the McIntosh is unknown, but the Snow Apple (or Fameuse), Fall St Lawrence, and Alexander have been speculated. It is one of the top five apple cultivars used in cloning, and research indicates the McIntosh combines well for winter hardiness. If unsprayed, the McIntosh succumbs\"",

From 1996, they were divided into two species: the Bornean orangutan (\"\"P. pygmaeus\"\", with three subspecies) and the Sumatran orangutan (\"\"P. abelii\"\"). In November 2017 it was reported that a third species had been identified, the Tapanuli orangutan (\"\"P. tapanuliensis\"\").

Sometimes referred to as 'mop dogs', the Komondor is a long-established powerful dog breed that has a natural guardian instinct to guard livestock and other property. The Komondor was brought to Europe by the Cumans and the oldest known mention of it is in a Hungarian codex from 1544. The Komondor breed has been declared one of Hungary’s national treasures, to be preserved and protected from modification.\"",

Derived from the Wichianmat landrace, one of several varieties of cat native to Thailand (formerly known as Siam), the Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century. The carefully refined modern Siamese is characterized by blue almond-shaped eyes; a triangular head shape; large ears; an elongated, slender, and muscular body; and point colouration.
